excerpt: 'Developed MMSQL, a test suite that evaluates how well LLMs manage different question types and multi-turn interactions. Additionally, created a multi-agent system to better identify question types and select appropriate strategies. Experiments show that this approach enhances the models&apos; ability to navigate conversational complexities.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have boosted text-to-SQL systems, but many miss the mark on handling real-world conversations. This can lead to issues with tricky questions that SQL alone can&apos;t solve. To tackle this, we created MMSQL, a test suite that checks how well LLMs handle different question types and multi-turn chats. We tested popular LLMs and found what affects their performance. Plus, we developed a multi-agent system to better identify question types and choose the right strategies. Our experiments show this enhances model&apos;s ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics.
